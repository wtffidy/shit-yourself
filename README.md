# THE "YOU WON'T READ THIS ANYWAY" README

Alright, you've somehow stumbled into this repository. Congratulations, I guess? Let's get one thing straight: you're not going to read this. But hey, since you're here, let's have some fun.

## WTF is This Repo?

Seriously, what the hell are you doing here? This is just a pile of code that I threw together when I was bored. It's probably garbage, but hey, maybe you'll find something useful. Or not. Who cares?

## How to Install this Dumpster Fire

Oh great, now you actually want to install this crap? Fine, here's what you do:

1. **Clone this shit:** Run this command in your terminal and hope it doesn't explode.
   
git clone https://github.com/wtffidy/shit-yourself.git

2. **Run Away:** Once you've cloned it, run for the hills and never look back. Trust me, it's for the best.

## How to Use this Hot Mess

You want to use this stuff? Are you serious? Fine, here's a tip: don't. Just randomly mash your keyboard and hope for the best. It'll probably work better than whatever's in this repository.

## Contributing? LOL

Oh, you want to contribute? That's hilarious. But hey, if you're feeling masochistic, go ahead and submit a pull request. Just don't expect me to actually merge it. I have better things to do, like watching paint dry.

## License? Who Gives a Shit?

Oh yeah, there's probably some boring license attached to this crap. But let's be real, you're not going to read it. Just assume it's some generic license that nobody cares about. Because guess what? Nobody cares.

## Need Help? Tough Luck

Got questions? Need help? Tough shit. Figure it out yourself. I'm not your tech support. But hey, if you're feeling lonely, go ahead and open an issue. I might respond. Or maybe not. Who knows?

And there you have it, the most pointless README you'll ever read. But hey, at least now you can say you've wasted your time on something truly useless. Congrats!
